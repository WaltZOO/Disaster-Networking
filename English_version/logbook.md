** Instructions and Best Practices **

* Use Markdown: nothing else is accepted
* Use [PlantUML](https://github.com/donsez/bd/tree/main/plantuml#readme) for diagrams: nothing else is accepted (i.e. no online editors etc.)
* Prefer SVG for vector diagrams over PNG and JPEG (HEIC is worst)
* PDF, DOCX, PPT, ODT, ODP are banned (otherwise `git rm *.pdf, *.pptx *.docx ...`)
* Use Markdown and [reveal.js](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) for your presentations (inside a folder in the `./presentations` directory)
* For slide themes, consider color blindness (black and white is timeless)
* Anything not written was not done
* Anything temporary is definitive (we’ll clean up later, quickly…)
* later == never
* write in English --> your projects will be visible to employers, internship supervisors...
* docker, docker, docker
* git, git, git
* in oral presentations (clients, etc.): avoid slang like “wesh wesh”, “vite fait”, “rapide”, “carré”... you’re not on the French RAP scene!
* [Contextual intelligence](https://www.wikiberal.org/wiki/Intelligence_contextuelle)
* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is your friend
