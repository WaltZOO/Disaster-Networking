# Guidelines for LoRa Deployment in Mixed Medium-Sized Environments with Extensions (TailleMoyenneMixteExt)

## Specific Considerations

- **Communication in Mountainous Environments**: If a mountain lies between two endpoints and it is not possible to install a relay at the mountain's summit, communication between these endpoints will be impossible. In this case, it is recommended to explore alternative routes or consider bypass solutions to maintain network connectivity.

## Conclusion

In cases where a mountain lies between two endpoints without the possibility of installing a relay at the summit, reliable communication between these points cannot be ensured. Therefore, it is necessary to reconsider network deployment under such conditions.
